A Data and SQL Project.


Following an eight-week Code First Girls Kickstarter Data and SQL Course from September 5 2023 to 3Oth October, when I submitted this project as a requirement to pass the course. It was based on data for an Express Grocery Store containing a database populated with five tables and the attendant columns. Core and advanced SQL requirements were met in the project. These requirements are clarified in the project document.
