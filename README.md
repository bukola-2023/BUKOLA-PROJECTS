A Data and SQL Project.


Following an eight-week Code First Girls Kickstarter Data and SQL Course from September 5 2023 to 30th October, when I submitted this project as a requirement to pass the course. It was based on data for an Express Grocery Store containing a database populated with five tables and the attendant columns. Core and advanced SQL requirements were met in the project. 
Core requirements are as follows:
-  A Relational Database with five tables
-  Primary and Foreign Key Constraints
-  Joins
-  A View
-  A Stored Function 
-  An Example Query with a Subquery
-  DB diagram
- Advanced requirements:
- Trigger(s)
-  An Example Query with group by and having 
These requirements are clearly defined in the project document.
